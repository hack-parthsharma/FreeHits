# üôå Welcome to Free-Hit

- As we all prefer open-source softwares for our daily use, it can be difficult to find tools that are specific to our needs. This is where **Free-Hit** comes in.
- Free-Hit is a tool used to search for open-source projects that are both free and helpful for our needs
- Although Free-Hit is a powerful tool to search for open-source projects, we recognize that it is still evolving. It will take time for us to add all the projects,resources and additional content that our users want.
- That's why, we encourage contributions from everyone interested in making Free-Hit even more attractive and useful.
